# Calculator

This project is to learn about languages by building a lexer and parser for
arithmetic expressions like `1 + (2*3)`

The goal is to build both the lexer and parser from scratch in a more
function-oriented style (calling in "functional" feels like a stretch),
eschewing the usual Object Oriented approach that dominates so many examples.

## Running the tests

```
npm t
```
